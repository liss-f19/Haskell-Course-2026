# Homework 03

## Maybe Monad

1. **Maze navigation**

   A maze is represented as a map from positions to their neighbours in each direction:
   ```haskell
   type Pos = (Int, Int)
   data Dir = N | S | E | W deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
   type Maze = Map Pos (Map Dir Pos)
   ```
   A position may not have a neighbour in every direction (walls).

   (a) Write a function
   ```haskell
   move :: Maze -> Pos -> Dir -> Maybe Pos
   ```
   that attempts a single move in the given direction, returning `Nothing` if blocked by a wall.

   (b) Write a function
   ```haskell
   followPath :: Maze -> Pos -> [Dir] -> Maybe Pos
   ```
   that follows a sequence of directions from a starting position, short-circuiting to `Nothing`
   as soon as any step is blocked. Use the `Maybe` monad — do not pattern-match on `Nothing` manually.

   (c) Write a function
   ```haskell
   safePath :: Maze -> Pos -> [Dir] -> Maybe [Pos]
   ```
   that returns the full trace of positions visited (including the start), or `Nothing` if the
   path is blocked at any point.

2. **Decoding a message**

   A substitution cipher maps each character to another. Given a partial decryption key
   (not every character may be known yet):
   ```haskell
   type Key = Map Char Char
   ```
   write a function
   ```haskell
   decrypt :: Key -> String -> Maybe String
   ```
   that decodes the entire string, returning `Nothing` if any character in the input is missing
   from the key. Use `traverse` with the `Maybe` monad.

   Then write
   ```haskell
   decryptWords :: Key -> [String] -> Maybe [String]
   ```
   that decrypts a list of words, failing if any single word cannot be fully decoded.

## List Monad

3. **Seating arrangements**

   You are organising a dinner and must assign guests to seats around a table.
   Some pairs of guests have conflicts and must not sit next to each other.
   ```haskell
   type Guest = String
   type Conflict = (Guest, Guest)
   ```
   Write a function
   ```haskell
   seatings :: [Guest] -> [Conflict] -> [[Guest]]
   ```
   that returns all valid permutations of the guest list such that no two conflicting guests
   are adjacent (the table is round, so the last and first guests are also neighbours).
   Use the list monad to generate permutations and `guard` to filter out invalid ones.

## Custom Monad

4. **Result monad with warnings**

   Define a type
   ```haskell
   data Result a = Failure String | Success a [String]
   ```
   where `Failure msg` represents a computation that failed with an error message, and
   `Success val warnings` represents a successful computation carrying a value together with
   a list of accumulated warning messages.

   (a) Implement `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` instances for `Result`.
   Warnings should be accumulated (concatenated) when sequencing computations.

   (b) Write helper functions:
   ```haskell
   warn    :: String -> Result ()
   failure :: String -> Result a
   ```

   (c) Use the `Result` monad to implement a function
   ```haskell
   validateAge :: Int -> Result Int
   ```
   that fails if the age is negative, warns if the age is above 150, and otherwise succeeds with the age.
   Then implement
   ```haskell
   validateAges :: [Int] -> Result [Int]
   ```
   that validates a list of ages, accumulating all warnings. Use `mapM`.

## Writer Monad

5. **Evaluator with simplification log**

   Given the expression type:
   ```haskell
   data Expr = Lit Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr | Neg Expr
   ```
   write a function
   ```haskell
   simplify :: Expr -> Writer [String] Expr
   ```
   that applies algebraic simplification rules and logs each rule applied. The rules should include
   at least:
   - `Add (Lit 0) e` or `Add e (Lit 0)` simplifies to `e` (additive identity)
   - `Mul (Lit 1) e` or `Mul e (Lit 1)` simplifies to `e` (multiplicative identity)
   - `Mul (Lit 0) _` or `Mul _ (Lit 0)` simplifies to `Lit 0` (zero absorption)
   - `Neg (Neg e)` simplifies to `e` (double negation)
   - `Add (Lit a) (Lit b)` simplifies to `Lit (a+b)` (constant folding)
   - `Mul (Lit a) (Lit b)` simplifies to `Lit (a*b)` (constant folding)

   Each time a rule fires, log a message like `"Add identity: 0 + e -> e"`.
   Apply simplification recursively (bottom-up: simplify subtrees first, then the root).

## Additional (extra assignment)

6. **ZipList — an Applicative that is not a Monad**

   `ZipList` applies functions to elements *positionally* (by zipping), rather than generating all combinations like the standard list `Applicative`:
   ```haskell
   newtype ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [a] } deriving (Show)
   ```

   (a) Implement the `Functor` and `Applicative` instances for `ZipList`:
   ```haskell
   instance Functor ZipList where
     fmap = ???

   instance Applicative ZipList where
     pure  = ???
     (<*>) = ???
   ```
   The idea behind `ZipList` is that `(<*>)` pairs up elements at matching positions (first with first, second with second, etc.). For `pure`, you need a `ZipList` that acts as a neutral element — it should work with any list regardless of length.

   (b) Verify that your instance satisfies the applicative laws by testing:
   ```haskell
   pure id <*> ZipList [1,2,3]                          -- should be ZipList [1,2,3]
   pure (+) <*> ZipList [1,2,3] <*> ZipList [10,20,30]  -- should be ZipList [11,22,33]
   ```

   (c) Explain (in a comment) why `ZipList` cannot have a lawful `Monad` instance. Specifically, what goes wrong when you try to define `>>=`? Consider what happens when the function passed to `>>=` returns lists of different lengths.
